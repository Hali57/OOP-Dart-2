  TASK:
        create a teacher and student classes
        initialize the classes with appropriate attributes
        create a third class that will call their methods by creating teacher and student  objects.

SOLUTION:

        i'll achieve the third part by creating a School class with a displayInfo method that the other two classes can inherit.
        i'll then use this class in a function to create student and teacher objects that will output their respective infomation.
        in short i'll use polymorphism to solve this task.
